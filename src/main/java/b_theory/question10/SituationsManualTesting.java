    ============== Q1: When should you use manual testing? ===============
    1. When quicker feedback is required, such as in the start of development.
    2. When X cannot be automated and must be manually tested
    3. Testing usability; automated testing can only reach so far, and
    some things such as user experience cannot be tested with tools.
    ==================================================================

    ======= Q2: Let's suppose you would like to automate some of your testing. What type of testing should you use (unit, integration, e2e)? Pick 1. =======
    Unit testing.
    ====================================================================================================================================================

    ========================================== Q3: Why did you pick it? ==========================================
    I would pick integration testing as it allows for reliable checking of the software as a whole, by making
    sure that all components are successfully communicating with one another without trouble.
    In the case of time limitation however, I would choose unit testing as testing isolated components singularly is easier.
