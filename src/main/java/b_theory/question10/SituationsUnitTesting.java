    //  When should you use unit testing?
    //  - If you want to test a entire system as a whole, there may be many different parts of the
    //    system that might fail, and it might be difficiult to account for every problem and
    //    also know exactly where the problem is. UNIT testing allows testers to find the problems
    //    quicker and easier by testing the smallest logically seperated pieces of code like functions,
    //    interfaces and modules. So, they should be used when a tester wants to test each part of the system,
    //    which basically becmoes like a documentation for him/her. Using unit tests help the tester in
    //    many aspects of development like: Find bugs faster, facilitates changes and simplefies integration,
    //    quality of code etc etc.
    //
    //
    //  Name at least 3 good use cases for unit tests (types of classes/functions to test).
    //  1) One of the cases might be if you want to check if there is data returning from an API request.
    //     By checking the responseBody and Header for HTTP request.
    //  2) Functions which perform calculations, and you want to test if the calculation is done correctly,
    //     by comparing it with true answers.
    //  3) Another example is input data validation. Good cases of use might be: Mandatory Fields testing,
    //  Unique Field Values testing, Null value testing etc etc.
