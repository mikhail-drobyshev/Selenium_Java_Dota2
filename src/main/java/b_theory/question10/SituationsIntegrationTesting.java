    //  When should you use integration testing?
    //  - When testing several units are tested together to make sure system behaves as expected
    //  When to use and when not to use mocking?
    //  - We use mocks when we need to test interactions between a class under test and a particular interface
    //  ----------------
    //  We don't use mocks in integration test because the main goal
    //  is to verify that integrated system operates as expected so we can't verify
    //  when using mocked objects
