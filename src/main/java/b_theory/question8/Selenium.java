     =============== p3 - What is page object pattern? ===============
     Page object pattern is a design pattern in Selenium that represents

     website via the generated classes and methods.

     =============== p4 - What are the benefits of using page object pattern instead of scripting fields? ===============
     Reduce code duplication, and easier to implement test routines which in turn become more readable and allow for
     easier future maintenance.
